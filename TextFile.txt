Explode Items to new Lanes

An easy way to take advantage of the lanes feature in Reaper 7. Set all needed media items on one track, select them, and the script will create a new track lane for each item. Each track lane's media item will start at the same time as the earliest selected item, and be set to a color gradient based off the tracks starting color.

Lane Shuffle

Need help getting an idea what a Wwise random container will feel like prior to a render? This script will shuffle through track lanes in a selected track randomly, select multiple tracks to get a sense of randomization between different layers of a sound.

Midi Circle (in progress)

Similar to an XY slider, but built around a circle instead. Select which parameters you want to control in a track (volume, pan, or a parameter from a plugin) and then select how your mouses position in the circle controls that parameter (X axis, Y axis, Distance to center, or the angle to the center of the circle) when the mouse leaves the circle, the value will revert to the value when the mouse first entered the circle.
